 Description: read a string from stdin - the implementation of read
 supplied by Xilinx is bugged.
 CR-LF is replaced by LF at the end of a line and CR is not counted in the
 number of characters returned. Also a null character is added to terminate
 the string.

 History:

  2009/01/21: IM Some terminals send CR only instead of CR/LF sequence
                 Code modified to treat both cases
